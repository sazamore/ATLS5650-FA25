### Lab 8 - Pygame Projects<br>
There are 6 exemplary projects, which have been anonymized and many given names. They are:<br>
    - `BubbleClickGame.py` - Selected for unique game design, exploration of window size, exemplary use of sound (numpy)<br>
    - `ClickGame_pygame.py` - Selected for unique game design, uses of visual reward (gentle screen flash)<br>
    - `Cookie_clicker_challenge.py` - Selected for clear use of template to build code (note cleanliness and expandability), very clear instructios and use of distractors. **Note** this code uses an image (successfully) be sure to also donwload `cookie.png` to the same folder so the code executes properly.<br>
    - `GnomeFrogger.py` - Selected with color augmentation to increase visibility. This program aws chosen for addictive quality from increased challenge across levels.<br>
    - `RacingGame.py` - Selected for expandability. The script can easily be organized into functions and eventually objects.<br>
    - `TypeBlast.py` - Selected for increase in challenge (speed), very unique game design, and use of pygame template. Note the expandibility from use of the template.<br>
